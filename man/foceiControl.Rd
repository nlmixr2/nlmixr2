 \item The tolerance of the ODE solvers is
 \code{0.5*10^(-sigdig-2)}; For the sensitivity equations and

 (sensitivity changes only applicable for liblsoda)

 \item The tolerance of the boundary check is \code{5 * 10 ^ (-sigdig + 1)}

}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[nlmixr2est:foceiControl]{nlmixr2est::foceiControl()}}.}

\item{epsilon}{Precision of estimate for n1qn1 optimization.}

\item{maxInnerIterations}{Number of iterations for n1qn1
optimization.}

\item{maxOuterIterations}{Maximum number of L-BFGS-B optimization
for outer problem.}

\item{n1qn1nsim}{Number of function evaluations for n1qn1
optimization.}

\item{print}{Integer representing when the outer step is
printed. When this is 0 or do not print the iterations.  1 is
print every function evaluation (default), 5 is print every 5
evaluations.}

\item{printNcol}{Number of columns to printout before wrapping
parameter estimates/gradient}

\item{scaleTo}{Scale the initial parameter estimate to this value.
By default this is 1.  When zero or below, no scaling is performed.}

\item{scaleObjective}{Scale the initial objective function to this
value.  By default this is 0 (meaning do not scale)}

\item{normType}{This is the type of parameter
    normalization/scaling used to get the scaled initial values
    for nlmixr2.  These are used with \code{scaleType} of.

    With the exception of \code{rescale2}, these come
    from
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling}{Feature
    Scaling}. The \code{rescale2} The rescaling is the same type
    described in the
    \href{http://apmonitor.com/me575/uploads/Main/optimization_book.pdf}{OptdesX}
    software manual.

    In general, all all scaling formula can be described by:

    v_{scaled} = (v_{unscaled}-C_{1})/C_{2}

    Where


    The other data normalization approaches follow the following formula

    v_{scaled} = (v_{unscaled}-C_{1})/C_{2};

\itemize{

\item \code{rescale2} This scales all parameters from (-1 to 1).
    The relative differences between the parameters are preserved
    with this approach and the constants are:

    C_{1} = (max(all unscaled values)+min(all unscaled values))/2

    C_{2} = (max(all unscaled values) - min(all unscaled values))/2


\item \code{rescale} or min-max normalization. This rescales all
    parameters from (0 to 1).  As in the \code{rescale2} the
    relative differences are preserved.  In this approach:

    C_{1} = min(all unscaled values)

    C_{2} = max(all unscaled values) - min(all unscaled values)


\item \code{mean} or mean normalization.  This rescales to center
    the parameters around the mean but the parameters are from 0
    to 1.  In this approach:

    C_{1} = mean(all unscaled values)

    C_{2} = max(all unscaled values) - min(all unscaled values)

\item \code{std} or standardization.  This standardizes by the mean
     and standard deviation.  In this approach:

    C_{1} = mean(all unscaled values)

    C_{2} = sd(all unscaled values)

\item \code{len} or unit length scaling.  This scales the
   parameters to the unit length.  For this approach we use the Euclidean length, that
   is:

    C_{1} = 0

    C_{2} = sqrt(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2)


\item \code{constant} which does not perform data normalization. That is

    C_{1} = 0

    C_{2} = 1

}}

\item{scaleType}{The scaling scheme for nlmixr2.  The supported types are:

\itemize{
\item \code{nlmixr2}  In this approach the scaling is performed by the following equation:

   v_{scaled} = (v_{current} - v_{init})/scaleC[i] + scaleTo

The \code{scaleTo} parameter is specified by the \code{normType},
and the scales are specified by \code{scaleC}.

\item \code{norm} This approach uses the simple scaling provided
    by the \code{normType} argument.

\item \code{mult} This approach does not use the data
normalization provided by \code{normType}, but rather uses
multiplicative scaling to a constant provided by the \code{scaleTo}
argument.

  In this case:

  v_{scaled} = v_{current}/v_{init}*scaleTo

\item \code{multAdd} This approach changes the scaling based on
the parameter being specified.  If a parameter is defined in an
exponential block (ie exp(theta)), then it is scaled on a
linearly, that is:

  v_{scaled} = (v_{current}-v_{init}) + scaleTo

Otherwise the parameter is scaled multiplicatively.

   v_{scaled} = v_{current}/v_{init}*scaleTo

}}

\item{scaleCmax}{Maximum value of the scaleC to prevent overflow.}

\item{scaleCmin}{Minimum value of the scaleC to prevent underflow.}

\item{scaleC}{The scaling constant used with
    \code{scaleType=nlmixr2}.  When not specified, it is based on
    the type of parameter that is estimated.  The idea is to keep
    the derivatives similar on a log scale to have similar
    gradient sizes.  Hence parameters like log(exp(theta)) would
    have a scaling factor of 1 and log(theta) would have a scaling
    factor of ini_value (to scale by 1/value; ie
    d/dt(log(ini_value)) = 1/ini_value or scaleC=ini_value)

   \itemize{

   \item For parameters in an exponential (ie exp(theta)) or
   parameters specifying powers, boxCox or yeoJohnson
   transformations , this is 1.

   \item For additive, proportional, lognormal error structures,
   these are given by 0.5*abs(initial_estimate)

   \item Factorials are scaled by abs(1/digamma(initial_estimate+1))

   \item parameters in a log scale (ie log(theta)) are transformed
   by log(abs(initial_estimate))*abs(initial_estimate)

   }

   These parameter scaling coefficients are chose to try to keep
   similar slopes among parameters.  That is they all follow the
   slopes approximately on a log-scale.

   While these are chosen in a logical manner, they may not always
   apply.  You can specify each parameters scaling factor by this
   parameter if you wish.}

\item{derivMethod}{indicates the method for calculating
derivatives of the outer problem.  Currently supports
"switch", "central" and "forward" difference methods.  Switch

differences when abs(delta(OFV)) <= derivSwitchTol and switch
back to forward differences when abs(delta(OFV)) >
derivSwitchTol.}

\item{derivSwitchTol}{The tolerance to switch forward to central
differences.}

\item{covDerivMethod}{indicates the method for calculating the
derivatives while calculating the covariance components

    function. The S matrix is the sum of individual
    gradient cross-product (evaluated at the individual empirical
    Bayes estimates).

\itemize{

 \item "\code{r,s}" Uses the sandwich matrix to calculate the
 covariance, that is: \code{solve(R) \%*\% S \%*\% solve(R)}

 \item "\code{r}" Uses the Hessian matrix to calculate the
 covariance as \code{2 \%*\% solve(R)}

\item{optimHessType}{The hessian type for when calculating the

"forward".  The central differences is what R's `optimHess()`

faster and still reasonable for most cases).  The Shi21 cannot be
changed for the Gill83 algorithm with the optimHess in a
generalized likelihood problem.}

\item{optimHessCovType}{The hessian type for when calculating the
individual hessian by numeric differences (in generalized
log-likelihood estimation).  The options are "central", and
"forward".  The central differences is what R's `optimHess()`
uses.  While this takes longer in optimization, it is more
accurate, so for calculating the covariance and final likelihood,
the central differences are used. This also uses the modified
Shi21 method}

\item{eventType}{Event gradient type for dosing events; Can be
"central" or "forward"}

\item{centralDerivEps}{Central difference tolerances.  This is a
  numeric vector of relative difference and absolute difference.

\item{lbfgsPgtol}{is a double precision variable.

    where pg_i is the ith component of the projected gradient.

    On exit pgtol is unchanged.  This defaults to zero, when the
    check is suppressed.}

\item{lbfgsFactr}{Controls the convergence of the "L-BFGS-B"
method.  Convergence occurs when the reduction in the
objective is within this factor of the machine

covariance numbers before rejecting an estimate of the
covariance as the final estimate (when comparing sandwich vs
R/S matrix estimates of the covariance).  This number controls
how small the variance is before the covariance matrix is

objective function, which removes a 2*pi constant from the

Control Options for FOCEi

\details{
Note this uses the R's L-BFGS-B in \code{\link{optim}} for the
outer problem and the BFGS \code{\link[n1qn1]{n1qn1}} with that
allows restoring the prior individual Hessian (for faster
optimization speed).

However the inner problem is not scaled.  Since most eta estimates
start near zero, scaling for these parameters do not make sense.

This process of scaling can fix some ill conditioning for the
unscaled problem.  The covariance step is performed on the
unscaled problem, so the condition number of that matrix may not
be reflective of the scaled problem's condition-number.
